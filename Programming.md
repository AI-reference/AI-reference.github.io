#### Languages
There are many different programming languages, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some languages are used just to write scripts (a list of instructions to be executed automatically which could otherwise be ran by a human operator) and others to write massive software systems. In the AI bachelor you will learn to write code some of the most popular languages (and one of the most obscure too). 

Your will start writing code in Java, a well-established classic among the programming languages; like the Coca-cola of programming languages. Java is about middle of the road in high- vs low-level programming. High level programming means you can express your ideas in less code - further away from machine code (all the way down it’s ones and zeros). Low level programming languages are more difficult to master. They are closer to machine code and can manipulate memory directly and even work with single bytes in your machine. Examples of low level programming languages are C and C++. You may write some C code in one or two elective courses if you’d like (e.g. Hacking in C). 

The other very prominent programming language you will use in AI is Python. Python in the most popular programming language (recently surpassing Java). Python is a high-level programming language which was originally a scripting language but grew out to be a fully capable programming language. Python is great.

#### Programming styles
There are different styles of programming, each with their own use. Some of the styles you will learn in the bachelor: imperative programming (writing coded statements that change the state of your program), Object Oriented programming (defining your program in the context of objects of different classes with their own properties), functional programming (defining functions that behave the same every time you call them). I won’t go into depth into these different styles of programming, you learn these in your first programming courses. 

#### Data types
In programming, we work a lot with variables. Variables are names we can give to pieces of information so we can easily manipulate it. For example we can say `potato = 19 * grape`. Now we can use the variable `potato` to refer to the value `19 * grape`, where `grape` is another variable. 

These variables have a _type_. There are a number of predefined types we can use, but almost any programming language allows you to create your own data types as well. I will list some of the most used built-in data types in programming here.

* String - a string is just a piece of text, it is usually defined by "quotation marks".
* Character - often called a _char_ can contain a single character like 'a'.
* Integer - often called an _int_ is a whole number, like 1, 2, 6, -473, etc.
* Float - a float (sometimes called a double) can contain any real number, like 17.3456.

Depending on the programming language, you may have to tell the compiler (the program that transforms your code to machine-readable commands) what type a piece of information is at all times. In java for example, you always need to say what type of variable it is that your are making or using. A String variable in java is creates as follows:
```java
String name = "Jane Doe";
```
This is called _static typing_, you have to always say what type of data you are working with so the compiler doesn't get confused. Other languages that use static typing are C, C++, Scala, and more.

In other languages, for example Python, javascript and PHP, you do __not__ have to say what type of data your variable is. You can simple give the variable a name, and a value, and the compiler will figure out what it is by looking at the value. Example in python:
```python
name = "Jane doe"
```
This is called _dynamic typing_. 

Static typing allows the compiler to check for some obvious bugs before running the code, for example multipling a String by -3.67. These errors can be spotted by the editor while coding, which prevents you from having to debug your program from simple type errors. Dynamic typing is nice because it allows the programmer to write code quickly and change a variable however they want to. They do have to be more careful with writng their code to make sure all of it fits together nicely.

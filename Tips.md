#### Writing papers
In this section I will give some resoures that can help you write better papers. You will write many scientific reports and papers during your carreer at University, so it is good to have them look professional and read like some genius PhD wrote it. For tips on how to effectively **read** papers, look at the corresponding section on the [Tips](Tips.md#reading-papers) page.

Scientific papers are written in the context of solving a problem. When writing your paper always think back to the problem you wanted to solve. You can assume the reader has some background knowledge on the topic; for example, if you write a paper about a new smart algorithm to control traffic lights at intersections, you can assume the reader knows what an algorithm is. Do not use contractions like don't and can't, etc., use do not and cannot.

A scientific paper consists of various sections. I will mention some of the most common sections in order, with some information about them.

* Introduction / Background. In the introduction state the problem that you want to solve (if there is a clear problem)

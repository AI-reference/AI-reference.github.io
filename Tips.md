#### Reading papers
In your academic carreer you will read many scientific papers. Publishing scientific papers in journals is the primary way for academics to broadcast their research to the world. Papers have a rather iconic layout and knowing how to quickly read a paper to get an idea of the research and findings and how to read a paper thoroughly is key to extracting knowledge from scientific papers. I will briefly point out the most common sections of a paper and what information to get from it.

* Title - at the top of the paper you can read the title and the authors. The title is usually descriptive enough to immediately understand what the research is about. 
* Abstract - just below the title you can usually find an _abstract_. An abstract is a small summary of the paper which states the problem the research is trying to address, the way they did it, and the results. Abstracts are very concise and are no more than half a page (and that is a big one). Read this if you are looking for suitable research papers to serve as background research for your own study. 
* Introduction / background - in the introduction of the paper (sometimes called background), the authors describe the problem they are addressing, or the topic they are writing about. In this section they usually write why they are conducting the current research and discuss relevant previous studies briefly to let the reader know what has (not) been done recently with regard to this topic. The authors describe the scientific or societal relevance of the study to convince the reader their research is useful.
* Methods / materials / algorithms - in this section and other sections like this, the author describe their research in depth. They describe their data (if they are working with data), algorithms, methods of research, etc. Read this if you want to know how the researchers got to their results.
* Results - In this section, the researchers describe the results they found with their study.
* Conclusion - Authors draw conclusions from their results and describe their concequences. 
* Discussion - In this section, usually at the end of the paper (can be switched with conclusion), the authors discuss their research. They explain what they found in the context of the problem stated in the introduction, if it has real effects on their research field or society, etc. They also give recommendations for future research on things they forgot to do, or did not have time to do.
* References - very imporant to research papers are the references. If you reference knowledge from another scientific paper, you should mention that paper in the place you use this knowledge briefly, and mention the full paper title, authors, year, journal, and more in the list of references. If you are looking for similar research to the study you are reading, looking at the reference list for more papers is a good idea.

With these sections summarized, we can talk about how to properly read a paper.

To quickly skim a paper and get the gist of what they were researching and what they found you can read the abstract. You read the abstract to see if this paper is interesting or relevant to what you are currently studying. If it is relevant or intersting, you may want to read it in more detail. In this case, read the first part of the introduction to get an idea about why they conducted the research. Then read the conclusion. Now you know the conclusion the researchers drew from their results. For more information about the conclusion, or if some terms are unclear, you can read the results and discussion section. And finally, if you want to really know in depth the intricacies of the research, read the whole paper front to back. Do this if you want to know how the authors implemented their algorithm, or specifics like that.

So essentially, read the paper from the ends inward for increasingly specific information. The start and end are more global and are writting on a high level, in the context of the problem they want to solve, whereas the center of the paper contains the details.

#### Writing papers
In this section I will give some resoures that can help you write better papers. You will write many scientific reports and papers during your carreer at University, so it is good to have them look professional and read like some genius PhD wrote it. 

Scientific papers are written in the context of solving a problem. When writing your paper always think back to the problem you wanted to solve. You can assume the reader has some background knowledge on the topic; for example, if you write a paper about a new smart algorithm to control traffic lights at intersections, you can assume the reader knows what an algorithm is. 

In the previous section, on [how to read a paper](#reading-papers), I explained the main sections of a scientific paper. Now I will explain how to go about writing these sections. 

* Abstract - Usually you write the abstract of a paper last, when you can properly summarize the paper. State the topic of the paper or the problem you research addresses
* Introduction / Background. In the introduction, state the problem that you want to solve (if there is a clear problem you want to solve) and introduce the topic you are writing about. Also mention previous related research and briefly discuss the known results. 
* Methods - mention your data, algortihms, research methods, and anything else you use to get the results for your research thoroughly.
* Results - describe the results you found in your research
* Conclusion - Draw the line from the results back to the problem you are trying to solve. What do these reselts mean for this research topic?
* Discussion - discuss any problems you encountered during your research, any findings that stand out or are unexpected, and give recommendations for future research.

Some general writing tips:
* Use a [thesaurus](https://www.thesaurus.com) to find synonyms for words you often repeat, or to find a word that fits the context better.
* Use passive sentence structure, e.g.: _The data was gathered from this source_, instead of _We gathered the data from this source_.
* Proofread your document well to prevent any easy-to-spot grammar errors or typos.
* Save your final document as PDF, don't hand in file formats from editors (like word's .docx files)

#### Plagiarism
Plagiarism is copying other people's work without mentioning the source (and thereby portraying it as your own). Plagiarism is obviously not allowed, and is dealt with strictly at University. Some examples of plagiarism are:

* Handing in someone else's assignment as your own (or compying large parts);
* using other people's resources without mentioning the source;
* Copy text from other research papers without mentioning the source (transcribing in your own words included)

Just stay away from the shady grey areas and you will be fine. Plagiarism is dealt with by the exam board and can lead to some drastic measures.

Hello! My name is Thijs, I graduated from by bachelor AI at Radboud University in 2018 and I am in the final stage of my Master AI at Radboud. I hope my experiences can be of help to you during your bachelor AI.

On this reference page I will give tips, resources and links to useful content for the AI Bachelor program at Radboud University. The tips and information given on this page are just to get ahead of the crowd. You are not _behind_ if you donâ€™t know any of the things I mention here, you are just _ahead_ if you do. You will learn most of the concepts here in the bachelor, but it's never bad to have a head-start. Many resources will be in the form of useful Youtube videos.
